## ⚡ Simplified Key Features

### USDC-Backed Points System
- Points are backed by **USDC collateral** in partner vaults
- **Non-transferable** by design, tied to user addresses
- Prevents gaming through wash trading or artificial transfers
- Maintains authentic engagement tracking

### Partner Vault System
- Partners deposit **USDC collateral** to back point issuance
- **Quota-based minting** with daily and lifetime limits
- **Proportional withdrawals** of unused collateral
- Real-time **TVL backing** validation

### Streamlined Partner Integration
- **Simple APIs** for partner integration without complex setup
- **Action-based point distribution** through registered integrations
- **Configurable perk systems** for user rewards
- **Revenue sharing** between partners and protocol

### Enhanced Security & Controls
- **Emergency pause functionality** across all modules
- **Capability-based access control** for all admin functions
- **Comprehensive input validation** and overflow protection
- **Supply caps** and **daily mint limits** for economic safety

## 📊 Simplified Point Economics

### Core Business Flows
1. **Partner Onboarding** - Partners create vaults with USDC collateral
2. **Quota Management** - Daily/lifetime quotas based on collateral amounts
3. **Point Distribution** - Partners mint points against their quotas via registered actions
4. **User Redemption** - Users redeem points for perks or USDC through simple endpoints
5. **Revenue Sharing** - Perk revenue distributed between partners and protocol

### Economic Safeguards
- **1:1 USDC Backing** - All points backed by USDC collateral in partner vaults
- **Supply Caps** - Maximum total supply limits prevent inflation
- **Daily Mint Limits** - Rate limiting prevents abuse
- **Quota Validation** - Partners cannot exceed their allocated quotas
- **Emergency Controls** - Protocol-wide pause for security incidents
