# Alpha Points Protocol - Audit Branch

## 🎯 Purpose

This **audit** branch contains the **simplified, audit-ready version** of the Alpha Points Protocol smart contracts. All complex governance, staking, lending, and DeFi features have been removed to focus exclusively on **core business logic** as requested for the security audit.

## 📋 Audit Scope

### ✅ **INCLUDED (Core Business Logic)**
- **USDC Vaulting** - Partner collateral management and withdrawal controls
- **Point Quota Management** - Daily/lifetime quotas, validation, enforcement
- **Point Distribution** - Minting against quotas with proper accounting
- **PartnerCap Operations** - Partner onboarding and management
- **Perk Creation/Updating/Redemption** - Perk marketplace and revenue distribution
- **Point Handling** - Minting, burning, balance queries, supply tracking
- **Integration Endpoints** - Partner integration and user redemption APIs
- **TVL Backing** - USDC collateral backing with withdrawal safeguards

### ❌ **EXCLUDED (Out of Audit Scope)**
- Multi-signature governance systems
- Staking and APY reward calculations
- Lending and loan position management
- Time-release reward mechanisms
- Advanced DeFi protocol integrations

- **Enhanced**: More robust price management and validation
- **Simplified**: Removed multi-source aggregation, kept essential price feeds

## 🚀 Build and Test Instructions

### **Prerequisites**
```bash
# Ensure Sui CLI is installed
sui --version
```

### **Build Contracts**
```bash
# Build the simplified contracts
sui move build

# Should compile successfully with only minor warnings
```

### **Run Tests**
```bash
# Run all tests
sui move test

# Run with coverage
sui move test --coverage

# Expected: 54/55 tests passing (98.2% success rate)
```

### **Test Specific Modules**
```bash
# Test core functionality
sui move test core_simple_tests

# Test critical business logic
sui move test critical_admin_tests
sui move test critical_ledger_tests

```

## 📋 Audit Focus Areas

### **1. Economic Safeguards**
- Point supply caps and daily mint limits
- USDC collateral backing requirements
- Partner quota validation and enforcement
- Emergency pause mechanisms

### **2. Core Business Flows**
- USDC vault deposit/withdrawal logic
- Point minting against partner quotas
- Perk creation and redemption flows
